\begin{lemma}\label{lem:addition-negation-subtraction-at-least-size-1}
  Every algebraic formula where the root is an addition, subtraction or
  negation has at least size $1$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
  \uses{lem:addition-negation-subtraction-at-least-size-1}
  Every algebraic formula with size $0$ is a variable or a constant.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Proof by contraposition. Assume that $f$ is an algebraic formula that
  is neither a variable nor a constant. Then, the root of $f$ must be an
  addition, a subtraction or a negation. With
  \ref{lem:addition-negation-subtraction-at-least-size-1} it follows
  that $f$ has at least size 1.
\end{proof}
